INTRO:
>One fateful day, a sunny one in March, in fact, Skoimp was just doing his usual thing.
>His quest to find the Cool Fucking Sword and throw it at an innocent person continues.
>This time, however, during the hunt, he happened to come across a funny looking trap door.
>Being the curious little dumbass he is (Seriously, have you not heard of curiosity killing the cat?)...
>He decided to literally jump down that shit without even taking a SINGLE glance.
>Dumbass.

KHIZAR BASEMENT CLEAR:
>And with Ash from Pokemon dead (at least we think he is), it was time for Skoimp to escape the basement.
>On his way out, he happened to see something particular...
>A BIBLE!
>This thing's gonna tell us all where the Cool Fucking Sword is!
>(Skoimp does not know how to read)
LOAD TO CAVE

CAVE CLEAR:
>That was kind of messed up, but we don't care! Skoimp must go on!
>After the brief interaction with the Eli Goombas, there will be more of them.
>But that doesn't matter, what matters is GOLF! It's at hand!
>Although, the things Skoimp saw in that cave reminded him of a movie idea he had.
>A conceptual thriller with paranormal elements, revolving around the Mexican Revolution.
>Eh, sounds like a US Gov teacher made that.
